# cNFDrugScreening
This repository manages the code to analyze the results of drug screens in cNF organoids together with omics measurements of the tumor data. 

## Data repository
The data for this code is hosted on Synapse at http://synapse.org/cnfDrugResponse

## Current analysis
We are collecting omics measurements from cNF organoid samples together with drug response data to identify potential biomarkers of drug response.
